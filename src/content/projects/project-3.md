**Project Overview:**

This project was built entirely inside of XFdtd, an Enterprise Electromagnetic Simulation Software.

User's reported the Huygens workflow cumbersome, so I created an automated version of the workflow that allows the user to control each of the important elements of the simulation.

It is written entirely in a JavaScript ECMA based language specific to XFdtd.

The controller allows users to save or load a configuration of their Huygens simulation inside of the project directory
Specify the geometry assemblies to be included and excluded from the simulation
