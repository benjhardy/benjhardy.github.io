**Other Publications I've Coauthored:**
---------------------------------------

- [Animating Vital Signs in Radar Simulations: Comparing Physical Optics Against 28.5 GHz Channel Measurements](https://doi.org/10.1109/RadarConf2458775.2024.10548317)

I designed the Blender workflow to create the animations, processed the data, and wrote a significant portion of the paper.

- [Magnetic resonance imaging of mean cell size in human breast tumors](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28056)

I designed the code to segment cell images and calculate the mean cell size. The code was used to analyze the images of cancerous breast tissue samples. 

- [Regional differences in three-dimensional fiber organization, smooth muscle cell phenotype, and contractility in the pregnant mouse cervix](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr3530)

I designed the MRI coil to image the excised cervix. I prepped the samples for imaging by soaking in Gd based PBS solution. I also executed the imaging experiements on the Bruker 15.2T MRI scanner.

- [A Minibatch Alternating Projections Algorithm for Robust and Efficient Magnitude Least-Squares RF Pulse Design in MRI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2024.3515035)

I helped design the algorithm for exploring and evading local minima in the RF pulse design problem.
