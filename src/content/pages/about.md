## Ben Hardy - Physics PhD in Nashville, TN

**Greetings!** I'm Ben Hardy, I completed my PhD in physics in June of 2023 at Vanderbilt University.
I studied under [John C. Gore](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=008f9e8726f85704&q=John+Gore&si=APYL9bvbTYBlvjo9HgsKokb80VOuw9zV-z5EXyhbMKCadi8Rh3qtZz2cB5rviQOUEXwD4LWJecr8n261ZgXYsZETLyaJW3CDbA%3D%3D&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYsviY4Y2NAxUAE1kFHbUTDcUQ-pgMegQIBhAB&biw=1707&bih=912&dpr=2.25), where I focused on MRI hardware development, high resolution imaging theory, and RF coil simulation.



## Skills and Expertise

The best way to see my skills in action is to check out the homepage of this site, where I have a few projects listed.

- **Python**: I primarily work with Python and libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, PIL, and Matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning**: I have experience with machine learning techniques and libraries, including TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **C++**: I have some C++ experience from my time at Remcom.
- **MATLAB**: I have experience with MATLAB for numerical analysis and simulation.
- **C**: I wrote a lot of C code for my PhD, including some low level C code for interfacing with MRI scanners.
- **LaTeX**: I have experience with LaTeX for typesetting documents and creating professional reports.
